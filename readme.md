## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Javascript animates the logo animation on page load as well as the button behavriors and CSS media queries implement responsive design decisions on smaller screen widths.

## Optimizations

I hope to eventually implement more functionality as well as refactor some lines of CSS.

## Lessons Learned:

This was the most amount of CSS by far (~4 thousand lines I beleive) getting the cascade to function properly for my design taught me alot about what to prioritize for effective viewing.

<!-- ## Examples:
